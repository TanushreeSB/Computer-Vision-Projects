1. Introduction:

Computer Vision enables machines to interpret and process visual data from the real world.
In this project, vehicle detection is performed on traffic footage using YOLO (You Only Look Once) — a deep learning-based real-time object detection model.
The goal is to automatically detect and identify vehicles such as cars, buses, trucks, and motorcycles in a video stream or camera feed, which can be applied for traffic monitoring and management.

2. Objective:

To build a system that can detect and classify different types of vehicles in traffic videos using deep learning techniques integrated with OpenCV.

3. Tools and Technologies:

Tool / Library	Description
Python	Programming language used for implementation
OpenCV	For video capture, frame processing, and visualization
Ultralytics YOLOv8	Pre-trained deep learning model for real-time object detection
NumPy	For numerical and matrix operations
Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook	Platform for running the project and visualizing results

4. Methodology / Working:

Step 1: Video Input

The system captures frames from a traffic video file or webcam using OpenCV.

Step 2: Object Detection Model

A pre-trained YOLOv8 model is used to detect objects in each frame.
YOLO divides the image into grids and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities simultaneously.

Step 3: Vehicle Classification

The model identifies objects belonging to vehicle categories such as car, bus, truck, motorcycle, etc.

Step 4: Bounding Box Drawing

Bounding boxes and labels are drawn around detected vehicles using OpenCV functions.

Step 5: Output Display

The processed frames are displayed or saved as a new annotated video.

6. Output

Detected vehicles are enclosed within bounding boxes labeled as car, truck, bus, etc.

Each frame of the video displays real-time detection results.

7. Applications

Intelligent Traffic Monitoring Systems

Vehicle Counting and Flow Analysis

Automatic Number Plate Recognition (as an extension)

Smart City and Road Safety Projects

8. Conclusion

This project demonstrates how deep learning and computer vision can be applied to automate vehicle detection in real-time traffic footage.
By using YOLOv8, the system achieves high accuracy and speed, making it suitable for real-world traffic surveillance and monitoring applications.
