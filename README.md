1) Face and Eye Detection

- The Face and Eye Detection System using OpenCV efficiently identifies faces and eyes in real-time video streams. 

- The use of Haar cascade classifiers ensures fast and reliable detection even on standard computing hardware. 

- This system forms the foundation for advanced vision applications such as emotion detection, facial recognition, and intelligent surveillance systems.
