1. Introduction:

Edges are one of the most important features in an image. They represent object boundaries and provide information about the shape and structure of objects.
In this project, we apply gradient-based edge detection techniques using OpenCV to extract edge information from digital images.

By using operators like Sobel, Laplacian, and Canny, the system detects areas of sharp intensity change and visualizes the edges.

2. Objective:

To detect and visualize image edges using gradient-based methods, helping in object boundary detection and feature extraction.

  
3. Tools and Technologies:
  
Tool / Library	Description
Python	Programming language used for implementation
OpenCV	Image processing library used for edge detection
NumPy	For handling image arrays and matrix operations
Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook	Platform for implementation and visualization

  
4. Methodology / Working:
  
Step 1: Image Input

Load an input image using OpenCV and convert it to grayscale to simplify computation.

Step 2: Gradient Calculation

Compute gradients using the Sobel Operator to find intensity changes in the x and y directions.

Step 3: Laplacian Operator

Apply the Laplacian operator to detect regions with rapid intensity change, providing a sharper edge representation.

Step 4: Canny Edge Detection

Apply Canny Edge Detection, a multi-stage algorithm that uses gradients and thresholding to detect edges more accurately.

Step 5: Visualization

Display the original image along with edge-detected images for comparison.

5. Output

7. Conclusion

The project demonstrates how gradient-based edge detection helps extract essential structural information from images.
Using OpenCV’s Sobel, Laplacian, and Canny operators, edges and boundaries are efficiently identified, forming the foundation for advanced computer vision applications such as object recognition, tracking, and scene understanding.
