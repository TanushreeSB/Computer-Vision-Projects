1) Face and Eye Detection

- The Face and Eye Detection System using OpenCV efficiently identifies faces and eyes in real-time video streams. 

- The use of Haar cascade classifiers ensures fast and reliable detection even on standard computing hardware. 

- This system forms the foundation for advanced vision applications such as emotion detection, facial recognition, and intelligent surveillance systems.

2) Vehicle Detection in Traffic Footage

- Detects and counts vehicles using a pretrained YOLO model.

3) Cartoonify an Image

- Turns any photo into a cartoon-style image. 


4) Gradient and Edge Detection using OpenCV

- In this project, we apply gradient-based edge detection techniques using OpenCV to extract edge information from digital images.

By using operators like Sobel, Laplacian, and Canny, the system detects areas of sharp intensity change and visualizes the edges.
