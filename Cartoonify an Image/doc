# Methodology / Working

Step 1️: Image Acquisition

The system reads the input image using cv2.imread().

Step 2: Grayscale Conversion

Convert the color image to grayscale using cv2.cvtColor() to simplify processing.

Step 3: Noise Reduction

Apply median blur to smooth the image and remove unwanted noise.

Step 4: Edge Detection

Detect prominent edges using adaptive thresholding — this helps create the cartoon outline.

Step 5: Color Filtering

Apply a bilateral filter to retain strong edges but smoothen color regions.

Step 6: Combining Results

Combine the color-filtered image with the edge mask using bitwise operations to form the final cartoon image.


Output:

The program converts the input image into a cartoon-styled image with bold outlines and smooth color regions.
